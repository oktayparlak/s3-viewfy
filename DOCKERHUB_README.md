# S3 Viewfy

A modern web-based file manager for **any S3-compatible object storage**. Browse, upload, download, and delete files through a sleek dark-mode UI.

Works with **AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, Hetzner**, and more.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key \
  -e S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key \
  -e S3_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e AUTH_USERNAME=admin \
  -e AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secure-password \
  oktayparlak/s3-viewfy
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — you're connected.

## Environment Variables

### S3 Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | ✅ | S3-compatible endpoint URL |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | ✅ | Access key |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | ✅ | Secret key |
| `S3_REGION` | ✅ | Storage region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | ❌ | Go directly to a specific bucket |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | ❌ | Default `true`. Set `false` for AWS virtual-hosted style |

### Authentication

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | ❌ | Username for login. Auth disabled if not set. |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | ❌ | Password for login. Both must be set to enable auth. |

When all required S3 variables are set, the app **auto-connects** on startup.

When `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` are set, users must **log in** before accessing the file manager.

When auth variables are **not set**, the app is open to anyone with the URL.
